# My Tkinter App

This is a simple Python application that uses Tkinter to create a user interface for network operations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x and pip installed on your machine. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and pip is included in Python 3.6 and later versions.

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/ahmetmelihafsar/cs408_lab_01.git
```

Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd cs408_lab_01
```

Run the application.

```
python src/main.py
```

## Functionality

The application has a user interface with two grids. The left grid contains labels and input boxes for IP, port, and message. It also has a connect button. The right grid contains a rich textbox for outputs.

When you enter the IP, port, and message and click the connect button, the application calls a function. This function is used to establish a network connection and send the message.
